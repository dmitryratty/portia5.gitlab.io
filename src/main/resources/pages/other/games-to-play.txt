"Why Everything is Becoming a Game". </> Skinner's goal was to make his pigeons peck the button as many times as possible. From his experiments, he made three discoveries. First, the pigeons pecked most when doing so yielded immediate, rather than delayed, rewards. Second, the pigeons pecked most when it rewarded them randomly, rather than every time. Skinner's third discovery occurred when he noticed the pigeons continued to peck the button long after the food dispenser was empty, provided they could hear it click. He realized the pigeons had become conditioned to associate the click with the food, and now valued the click as a reward in itself. </> Skinner's three key insights — immediate rewards work better than delayed, unpredictable rewards work better than fixed, and conditioned rewards work better than primary...

</> Kaczynski was an awkward but gifted student, in a school IQ test he'd scored 167. </> In a lab not far from where Skinner had once experimented with pigeons, psychologists linked to US intelligence were now experimenting with humans — one of whom was Kaczynski. Under the glare of blinding lights, he was methodically humiliated to see how he reacted. He claimed the experience didn't affect him, and yet, within just a few years, he'd developed an intense paranoia about psychological conditioning.

</> Casinos keep their customers happily losing money by distracting them with minor side games they're likely to win. The small victories convince them they're winning overall even as they lose the only games that actually matter. </> This strange quirk of human behavior can even cost lives. In South Korea, a young couple became so addicted to raising a virtual baby that they let their real baby starve to death. The parents prioritized what they could quantify — levelling up their virtual baby — over that which they couldn't — the life of their real one.

</> So how do you decide which games to play? </> Even in a world where everything is a game, you don't have to play by other people's rules; you have a wide open world to create your own.
