    <p>Each of these four phrases, listed in Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct, has a distinct meaning:
        <br>‚Äî My sister's friend's investment.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> The investment belonging to a friend of my sister.
        <br>‚Äî My sister's friends' investment.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> The investment belonging to several friends of my sister.
        <br>‚Äî My sisters' friend's investment.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> The investment belonging to a friend of several of my sisters.
        <br>‚Äî My sisters' friends' investment.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> The investment belonging to several friends of several of my sisters.</p>

    <p>Kingsley Amis, on being challenged to produce a sentence whose meaning depended on a possessive apostrophe, came up with:
        <br>‚Äî Those things over there are my husband's.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> Those things over there belong to my husband.
        <br>‚Äî Those things over there are my husbands'.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> Those things over there belong to several husbands of mine.
        <br>‚Äî Those things over there are my husbands.
        <br>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">-&gt;</span> I'm married to those men over there.</p>
