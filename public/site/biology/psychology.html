    <p>You've heard of cognition. Now, here's metacognition: the act of thinking about thinking. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; Arthur Brooks, author and public speaker, explains how metacognition helps us reflect on our emotional life, allowing our prefrontal cortex to evaluate signals from the limbic system. For instance, telling children to "use their words" instead of screaming encourages them to engage their prefrontal cortex. The same applies to adults: interrogate your emotions before reacting, and you might just become a more emotionally healthy person. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; According to Brooks, this is a skill that can be developed over time, so if you're new to the idea of consciously regulating your own emotions, it's not too late. He stresses that negative emotions ‚Äî though unenjoyable ‚Äî are entirely normal and are even representative of a healthy brain. What matters is how we engage with these negative emotions and what lessons we take away from the experiences they give us. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; Metacognition is a skill that requires patience and <span class="nowrap">self-kindness.</span> With enough practice and effort, we all can learn to master this ability and enhance our own happiness, as well as the happiness of those around us.

    <p>&lt;‚Ä¢&gt; A characteristic of autism is having special interests or passions and cognitive rigidity. The interests may involve collecting objects or information, but some interests could be interpreted as indicating schizophrenia. We knew an autistic adult who had an intense interest in medieval church law and, due to his reading of obscure religious texts, made the logical decision that the current Pope was illegitimate. He was determined to travel to the Vatican to denounce the Pope based on the evidence he had carefully analysed and collated. There were no accompanying signs of schizophrenia, but he was admitted to a secure psychiatric hospital and discharged when he discovered a replacement interest in computer games. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; A psychiatrist may ask a question such as, ‚ÄòDo you hear voices?' to which Wen Lawson, who is autistic, replied, ‚ÄòYes' ‚Äì the correct answer based on a literal interpretation of the question (Lawson, 1998). He heard voices of people talking around him every day. His answer contributed to the psychiatrist's opinion that he had schizophrenia.
