    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan credited his acumen to his family goddess, Namagiri Thayar of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her consort, Narasimha. Later he had visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, "An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.".</p>

    <p>&lt;‚Ä¢&gt; ‚Ä¶in 1920 he died at the age of 32. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; A 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptoms‚Äîincluding his past relapses, fevers, and hepatic conditions‚Äîwere much closer to those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, amoebic dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. At the time, if properly diagnosed, amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease; British soldiers who contracted it during the First World War were being successfully cured of amoebiasis around the time Ramanujan left England.</p>
