At the Conference Nationale Souveraine shortly before his death, Mabika Kalanda asked him, "Godefroid, you are one of the survivors who participated in the end of Patrice Émery Lumumba. Why would you not take advantage of the CNS to tell us your truth?" Munongo emotionally replied, "My dear Mabika, you put an important issue before me. What I can say at this stage is that I was not alone. We were numerous. We'll have to get all these people together. But anyway, I can say at that time, we were working, without realizing it, for the interests that were not ours. We were young". </> The family website records that Munongo was going to break his silence on the death of Lumumba, but on the day of the announcement, he suffered a heart attack and died on 28 May 1992. </> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godefroid_Munongo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba
