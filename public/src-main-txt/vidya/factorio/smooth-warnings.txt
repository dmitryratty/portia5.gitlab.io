I have a suggestion regarding one of the icons. In SmoothWarnings, there is currently a skeuomorphic battery icon, but I think the lightning icon shown when electricity is missing would look better, just make it red instead of yellow.

Alternatively, if keeping the battery icon, it could be drawn in some non-skeuomorphic way. Also icon selection can be an option in mod settings, in case someone prefer skeuomorphic battery icon.

It may be convenient if you make a repository with the code on GitLab or GitHub. I've made red lightning icon for battery about a year ago, just don't published it, but probably would do it if I was able to make pull request on GitLab or GitHub.
