A desert traveller is searching for water. He sees, in the valley ahead, a shimmering blue expanse. Unfortunately, it's a mirage. But fortunately, when he reaches the spot where there appeared to be water, there actually is water, hidden under a rock. Did the traveller know, as he stood on the hilltop hallucinating, that there was water ahead?

Part of my loves working in the chemical industry. We have processes that require machines that are as big as buildings. It's mostly pipes and valves and compressed air and vacuum lines and diaphragms and shit. These huge towers are so old that there's no one left alive in the industry that fully understands them. There might be some retirees but that's it and only if you're lucky. They still output perfectly fine product in large enough amounts and replacing them and updating them would be prohibitively expensive. </> So when something breaks, you can bust out the schematics, sure. Problem is there's been so many modifications and jerry-rigs throughout the decades that the schematics are not always reliable. So i'll find myself up in the tower with a team in hazmat gear (the chemicals we work with are lethal if inhaled, or if they contact skin in large enough amounts) trying to find that one fucking hose or some arcane fucking component to hunt down the specific problem. If a component cannot be repaired, there's no replacement parts. So we send it off to our machine shop and they reverse-engineer it and build a new one if they haven't already done that at some point in the past. </> Yeah, I get it. A machine bigger than most houses. With multiple walkways and ladders and access points that no one fully understands. Different monitoring systems that somehow manage to communicate with a central control room (which is reinforced and can hermetically seal itself in the event of a fume release or explosion) it certainly deserves a sense of reverence. I dunno if this will fix the problem but fuck it whack it with a wrench first and see if anything happens. </> Hell you should see our LDAR, leak detection and repair, techs. Hazmat gear and a sniffer probe on one arm to check gaskets for the most minute of leaks. a screen strapped to the other arm to display what the probe is picking up. And a backpack that contains the equipment needed to run the probe and to repair and replace things. Looks like a fucking techpriest sans robes. << From comments on "Noosphere | Adeptus Mechanicus Combat Music Music of 40K" https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU?si=x97cVDWULexvaGOc >>
