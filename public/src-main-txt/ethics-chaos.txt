The Three Kingdoms period including the collapse of the Han is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.

I was thinking the Three Kingdoms war numbers must be inflated, so I did some digging. And yeah it checks out... At the end of the Han dynasty (200 AD-ish), China made up around 25% of the world population. That means for 20% of the world population to die, basically 4/5 people in China would have needed to die. In the late Han Dynasty, a census reported a population of around 56 million people. After the Three Kingdoms period, once the Jin dynasty reunified China, another census reported a population of 16 million. That's basically 3/4 people in China dying during this period... Pretty darn close to the insane 4/5 figure. I'm suddenly feeling very lucky that I wasn't a Chinese peasant in 200 AD.

At the Conference Nationale Souveraine shortly before his death, Mabika Kalanda asked him, "Godefroid, you are one of the survivors who participated in the end of Patrice Émery Lumumba. Why would you not take advantage of the CNS to tell us your truth?" Munongo emotionally replied, "My dear Mabika, you put an important issue before me. What I can say at this stage is that I was not alone. We were numerous. We'll have to get all these people together. But anyway, I can say at that time, we were working, without realizing it, for the interests that were not ours. We were young". </> The family website records that Munongo was going to break his silence on the death of Lumumba, but on the day of the announcement, he suffered a heart attack and died on 28 May 1992. </> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godefroid_Munongo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba
