Think coolly and calmly. Reason step by step, write down the steps. You have all the statistics available to humanity. Calculate the average life expectancy of a person for a group of people that includes all people currently living. From the group of people that includes all people currently living, identify subgroups of people with certain characteristics whose average life expectancy within the subgroup differs significantly from the average life expectancy of people from the general group. Name these subgroups, indicating by what characteristics they are grouped and what is the average life expectancy within them.

    ### Step-by-Step Approach to Calculating the Average Life Expectancy of All Currently Living People

    We'll break this down into manageable parts, starting with defining the general group, calculating the average life expectancy, and then identifying subgroups with significantly different life expectancies.

    #### Step 1: Define the General Group
    The general group consists of all people who are currently alive. As of 2024, the global population is approximately **8.1 billion** people. The task is to calculate the **average life expectancy** for this entire population, which is a weighted average considering different factors like age, geography, and socioeconomic status.

    #### Step 2: Gather Relevant Data on Life Expectancy
    To calculate the average life expectancy of all living people, we need data on:
    - Average life expectancy at birth for different countries or regions.
    - The current age distribution of the global population.
    - Mortality rates at different ages.
    - Socioeconomic factors like healthcare access, income, etc.

    From global data sources (e.g., **United Nations**, **World Bank**, **WHO**):
    - The global average life expectancy at birth is around **72-73 years**.
    - Life expectancy varies significantly by country due to factors like healthcare, income, and social conditions.

    #### Step 3: Calculate the Average Life Expectancy of Currently Living People
    We will need to consider that the life expectancy at birth is different from the life expectancy for people who have survived to a certain age.

    - For people who are already alive, their expected remaining years of life depend on their current age. For example, a 60-year-old person has a different life expectancy than a newborn.
    - Therefore, to calculate the average life expectancy of all currently living people, we need to sum the remaining life expectancies of all people currently alive and divide by the total population.

    For simplicity, consider:
    - **Young children** (e.g., 0-5 years) have an expected remaining life of about 70 years (given that life expectancy at birth is 72-73).
    - **Adults aged 30-40** may have a remaining life expectancy of around 35-45 years depending on their health and country of residence.
    - **Elderly people** (e.g., people aged 80+) may have a remaining life expectancy of 5-10 years.

    Given this, the **average remaining life expectancy** of all currently living people will likely be **in the range of 40-50 years**.

    #### Step 4: Identify Subgroups with Differing Life Expectancies
    Now that we have estimated the global average life expectancy, let's identify subgroups with significantly different life expectancies based on characteristics like geography, gender, and socioeconomic status.

    ##### Subgroup 1: Geographic Region
    Life expectancy varies widely depending on the country or region due to differences in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle.

    - **High-income countries** (e.g., Japan, Switzerland, Australia):
      - Average life expectancy at birth: **82-84 years**.
    - **Low-income countries** (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan):
      - Average life expectancy at birth: **55-65 years**.

    ##### Subgroup 2: Gender
    Globally, women tend to live longer than men, by an average of 4-6 years.

    - **Women**:
      - Global average life expectancy at birth: **75-76 years**.
    - **Men**:
      - Global average life expectancy at birth: **69-71 years**.

    ##### Subgroup 3: Socioeconomic Status
    Socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and access to healthcare play a significant role in life expectancy.

    - **High-income individuals**:
      - In developed countries, individuals in the top income brackets can have life expectancies up to **10-15 years** longer than those in the lowest income brackets.
    - **Low-income individuals**:
      - In both developing and developed countries, lower-income individuals may experience higher mortality rates and shorter life expectancies due to poorer healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions.

    ##### Subgroup 4: Urban vs. Rural Populations
    Urban populations tend to have higher life expectancies due to better access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.

    - **Urban populations**:
      - Life expectancy is typically **2-5 years longer** than in rural areas, particularly in developing countries.
    - **Rural populations**:
      - In low-income countries, rural populations may have significantly lower life expectancies due to poor healthcare and infrastructure.

    ##### Subgroup 5: People with Chronic Conditions
    People with chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer tend to have shorter life expectancies than the general population.

    - **People with severe chronic conditions**:
      - Life expectancy can be **10-20 years shorter** than the average, depending on the condition and access to medical treatment.

    ##### Subgroup 6: People Living in Conflict Zones
    People living in war-torn or conflict-affected regions often have significantly lower life

    Okay, let's approach this step by step:

    1. Determine the average life expectancy for all people currently living:
       According to the United Nations, the global life expectancy at birth for the period 2020-2025 is estimated to be 72.6 years.

    2. Identify subgroups with significantly different life expectancies:

    a) By country:
       - Developed countries: People in developed countries tend to have higher life expectancies. For example, Japan has a life expectancy of 84.6 years, and Switzerland has 83.8 years.
       - Developing countries: People in developing countries generally have lower life expectancies. For instance, the Central African Republic has a life expectancy of 53.3 years, and Chad has 54.2 years.

    b) By gender:
       - Women: Globally, women tend to live longer than men. The average life expectancy for women is 75.6 years.
       - Men: The average life expectancy for men is 70.8 years.

    c) By socioeconomic status:
       - High-income individuals: People with higher incomes and better access to healthcare and education tend to have longer life expectancies. In the United States, for example, the life expectancy for the top 1% of income earners is 87.3 years for women and 84.4 years for men.
       - Low-income individuals: People with lower incomes often have shorter life expectancies due to limited access to healthcare, education, and other resources. In the United States, the life expectancy for the bottom 1% of income earners is 78.8 years for women and 72.7 years for men.

    d) By health behaviors:
       - Non-smokers: People who do not smoke have a higher life expectancy than smokers. In the United States, non-smokers have a life expectancy of about 80 years.
       - Smokers: Smokers have a lower life expectancy due to the health risks associated with smoking. In the United States, smokers have a life expectancy of about 72 years.

    These are just a few examples of subgroups with significantly different life expectancies compared to the global average. Other factors, such as education level, occupation, and access to healthcare, can also impact life expectancy within subgroups.
